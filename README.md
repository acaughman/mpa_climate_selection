2. .2 fishing .8 1 thick buffer
3. .5 fishing .2 1 thick buffer
4. .8 fishing .2 1 thick buffer
5. .5 fishing .8 2 thick buffer
6. .2 fishing .8 2 thick buffer

### Scenarios to Test Post-climate

##### MPA Size and Fishing Pressure

1. 2x2 .5 fishing no buffer
2. 2x2 .8 fishing no buffer
3. 2x2 .2 fishing no buffer
4. 3x3 .5 fishing no buffer
5. 3x3 .8 fishing no buffer
6. 3x3 .2 fishing no buffer
7. 4x4 .5 fishing no buffer
8. 4x4 .8 fishing no buffer
9. 4x4 .2 fishing no buffer

##### Climate Variability

Pick reasonable MPA and fishing pressure based on previous tests

1. Uniform Climate Increase
2. Random Generation about mean (small variation) each year with increasing mean
3. Random Generation about mean (ENSO variation) each year with increasing mean
